# IMPORTANT GUIDELINES


## Common
- Write concise, efficient code. 
- Don't be lazy, write all the code to implement features I ask for.
- Keep consistent with existing code if you can.
- Follow proper naming conventions.
- Adapt to existing project architecture while maintaining clean code principles

## COMMENTING:

- ALWAYS COMMENT the important logic CODE. 
- NEVER ERASE OLD COMMENTS IF THEY ARE STILL USEFUL.
- Use clear and concise language
- Avoid stating the obvious (e.g., don't just restate what the code does)
- Focus on the "why" and "how" rather than just the "what"


## LOGGING

- Ensure a variety of the different logging levels depending on the workflow and logic
